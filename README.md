Verne is a python code for calculating the Earth-stopping effect for Dark Matter (DM). 

The code allows you to calculate the speed distribution (and DM signal rate) at detectors in the Earth's atmosphere, on the Earth's surface and at underground detector locations, such as MPI (the Max-Planck-Institute in Munich) and SUF (the Stanford Underground Facility). This can be done for a range of DM masses and cross sections (though the results will be most reliable for very heavy DM particles). This is because the code implements a 'continuous stopping' formalism, with DM particles travelling on straight-line trajectories. Further details about the physics behind the code can be found in [arXiv:1712.04901](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.04901).

As of Version 2.0, there is now an additional module `verne_light`, which implements the Earth-scattering of very light DM, in which energy losses are negligible, and particles travel on straight-line trajectories with the possibility of reflection. Full details of the formalism will be presented in an up-coming paper. 

The core of the code (the `verne` and `verne_light` modules) is in the [src](src) folder, head there for some details of how to use the code.

### Version history

**Version 2.1 (07/05/2025):** Added ultra-light and heavy dark photon interactions for the original `verne.py` calculations.
**Version 2.0.1 (27/01/2025):** Fixed a minor bug related to interpolation of integrals over phi (extended interpolation range). 
**Version 2.0 (28/10/2024):** Major update to include support for light Dark Matter (see `verne_light.py`), as well as some restructing of the code. Dark-photon mediated interactions are currently only supported in `verne_light.py`.  
**Version 1.3.1 (13/10/2022):** Minor update to include interactions mediated by a heavy Dark Photon.  
**Version 1.3 (30/08/2022):** Major update to include millicharged DM interactions.  
**Version 1.2 (09/03/2021):** Major update to include spin-dependent interactions (and fix a few minor bugs). Now compatible with Python3.  
**Version 1.1 (12/02/2018):** Updated event rate calculation to account for correct CRESST exposure times. Minor edits to text.  
**Version 1.0 (14/12/2017):** Initial release (including arXiv numbers, etc.)  
**Version 0.9 (13/12/2017):** Pre-release before arXiv submission.  

### Contents

- `src`: Core of the `verne` code, including calculation scripts.
- `data`: A collection of data tables (Earth element density profiles, etc.) which are read in by `verne`. 
- `results`: Numerical results for the final speed distributions, numbers of signal events and constraints.
- `plotting`: Scripts for generating plots from the results.
- `plots`: Plots and illustrations summarising the key results. Mostly from [arXiv:1712.04901](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.04901).  
- `paper`: PDF and tex files for the associated paper.

### Getting started

The best place to start is probably the [example notebook](/src/Examples.ipynb). You can also find more detailed info in the README file for the [`src/`](src/) folder. I'm also very happy to provide more specific examples if you have something in particular in mind - just get in touch. 

### Dependencies

The code is compatible with Python3. Requires [numpy](http://www.numpy.org) and [scipy](https://www.scipy.org). More detailed dependencies can be found in `requirements.txt`.

Some code is included for calculating nuclear recoil spectra in direct detection experiments, but we recommend using [`WIMpy`](https://github.com/bradkav/WIMpy_NREFT) (which is more flexible and more complete) for recoil spectra calculations.
